# <Password-Generator>

## Description

For this challenge, we are given a task to generate password that meets certain criteria so that the users can create a strong password that provides greater security. Users have to click on the button to generate a password and presented a series of prompts for password criteria such as length of password of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters, and characters types to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters) they have to include at least one of the criteria in order for the password to be generated. And when all prompts are answered, a password will be generated and displayed written to the page. 

This is a very challenging project for me as I was struggling to understand the logic behind most of the codes. However with much help from my instructor, teacher's assistant, 1:1 tutoring and some help outside class, I was able to figure out the step by step method to solve this project. I was trying to put all the codes that I have learnt in class into action although it took me a while to work this project out but I never give up.
